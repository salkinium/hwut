# hwut? Hardware Unit Testing!



Four use-cases have been identified:

| Type | Description | Software Dependencies | Hardware Dependencies | 
|------|-------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| Logic | Pure software test of class logic. Not hardware dependend! Self-testing. | Stand-alone TAP Producer | Programmer, Uart |
| Performance | Tracking resources (time, ram, flash) of tests. Partially self-testing. | Stand-alone TAP Producer or external GBD as TAP Producer | (Programmer, Uart, Timer) or (OpenOCD, Embedded Tracing Cell) |
| Configuration | Confirming register values calculated by API. Must be side-effect free! | External GBD as TAP Producer | OpenOCD, Embedded Tracing Cell |
| Waveform | Confirming waveform generated by hardware, like error/jitter of Uart baudrate, correct bitorder, etc. | External GBD with SigRok as TAP Producer | OpenOCD, Embedded Tracing Cell, Logic Analyzer |


### Report generation

Will use [Test Anything Protocol (TAP)](testanything.org) for report generation, but with our own test descriptions and harness.


### Conformance to waveform

Uses [SigRok](sigrok.org) for waveform capture and analysis.
